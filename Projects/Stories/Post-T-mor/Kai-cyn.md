# Overview

A series of a Kai-cyn who had the ability to multiply his power with the consequence of it basically killing him : very inspired by the Kaio-Ken.

But he also has a healing factor which keeps him alive and not dead from it, but it gets him stronger.

So basically a Saiyan with Kaio-Ken and healing powers.

So, the healing powers can just be a thing regular Humans can have
