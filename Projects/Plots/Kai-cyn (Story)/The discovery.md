While [Kai](../../../Other/Characters/Kai-cyn.md) was participating in the 2nd Lilia Jinbi Mini of 2032 he was struck, HARD. Red electricity flowing through him violently as physics throws him out of the ring.

His opponent stares as Kai falls out of the ring, not even worry washing over his face, his focus purely on victory.

The bell rings, and some of the crowd cheers and the winner is stated.

"And the winner is [Osin](../../../Other/Characters/Osin.md)!"

The crowd roars, and Kai passes out.

Hours later, Kai wakes up in the Lilia Jinbi building in one of the healthcare sections. He's almost completely healed, just pain here and there.

A doctor comes into the room, smiling.

"Looks like I was correct." The Doctor says.

"Correct about what?" Kai asked. Confused.

"After watching over your condition after your initial knockout I came to the theory you are a [Anohun](../../../Other/Species/Anohun.md) with the HA 2 type. But later, closer to now, I've realized you have the HA 6 type, a merging of HA 2 and 5. Definitely one of the earlier levels, no more then 4, there'd have to be more instances of your anomaly coming into effect for an exact estimation..."

Kai stares at the doctor, silence fills the room for seconds that feel like days.
"And what are those?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. Anohuns are humans with anomalies, like how Meta-Humans have powers, but Anohuns are usually just minor mutations or quirks in comparison. HA 2 is Hiclin, it's basically a person who heals faster then normal, and even faster depending on the level, and HA 5 is Zekin and it makes your body adapt faster and with less exposure then normal."

"So... I heal faster and adapt quicker to danger?"

"Basically, yes."

"Cool!"

"Now, since you're almost healed I think it's time to talk the bill."

*Kai gulps*

"Well since we actually didn't do much thanks to my interference it's pretty cheap. About $80."

"Oh, could've been worse."

After a couple more hours, Kai is fully healed, pays the bill ($85.50), and leaves for home, now with the knowledge of his healing factor and adaptation.
