While [Kai](../../../Other/Characters/Kai-cyn.md) was participating in the 2nd Lilia Jinbi Mini he was struck, HARD. Red electricity flowing through him violently as physics throws him out of the ring.

His opponent stares as Kai falls out of the ring, not even worry washing over his face, his focus purely on victory.

The bell rings, and some of the crowd cheers and the winner is stated.

"And the winner is Osin!"

The crowd roars, and Kai passes out.

Hours later, Kai wakes up in the Lilia Jinbi building in one of the healthcare sections. He's almost completely healed, just pain here and there.

A doctor comes into the room, smiling.

"Looks like I was correct." The Doctor says.

"Correct about what?" Kai asked. Confused.

"After watching over your condition after your initial knockout I came to the theory you were one of the humans with the HA 2 anomaly. But later, closer to now, I've realized you have the HA 6 anomaly, a merging of HA 2 and 5."

Kai stares at the doctor, silence fills the room for seconds that feel like days.
"And what are those?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. HA 2 is Hiclin, it's basically a person who heals faster then normal, and even faster depending on the level, and HA 5 is Zekin and it makes your body adapt faster and with less exposure then normal."
