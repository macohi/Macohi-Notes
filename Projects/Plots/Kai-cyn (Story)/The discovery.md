While [Kai](../../../Other/Characters/Kai-cyn.md) was participating in the 2nd Lilia Jinbi Mini he was struck, HARD. Red electricity flowing through him violently as physics throws him out of the ring.

His opponent stares as Kai falls out of the ring, not even worry washing over his face, his focus purely on victory.

The bell rings, and some of the crowd cheers and the winner is stated.

"And the winner is Osin!"

The crowd roars, and Kai passes out.

Hours later, Kai wakes up in the Lilia Jinbi building in the healthcare section. He's almost completely healed, just pain here and there.
