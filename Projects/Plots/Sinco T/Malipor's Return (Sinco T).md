After [T-mor](../../Stories/T-mor.md), [Sinco](../../../Other/Characters/Sinco.md)'s moving through Tempo City trying to process all of these new memories, abilities and powers that he has just received.

When all of a sudden a purple blur flies straight at him, colliding and creating a crater in the ground.

"FINALLY, A NEW CHANCE TO KILL YOU ONCE AGAIN!" The blur speaks.

Sinco looks up, and he sees... himself... in his super form, but, purple?

Suddenly a flash a memories flicker in his mind.

"Malipor! You piece of shit you just won't stay DEAD."
