After [T-mor](../../Stories/T-mor.md), [Sinco](../../../Other/Characters/Sinco.md)'s moving through Tempo City trying to process all of these new memories, abilities and powers that he has just received.

When all of a sudden a purple blur flies straight at him, colliding and creating a crater in the ground.

"FINALLY, A NEW CHANCE TO KILL YOU ONCE AGAIN!" The blur speaks.

Sinco looks up, and he sees... himself... in his super form, but, purple?

Suddenly a flash a memories flicker in his mind.

"Malipor! You piece of shit you just won't stay DEAD."

"Not when I have a chance to put your face in the DIRT."

Malipor charges at Sinco, grabbing him and they fly through buildings, mountains, flying throughout the entire earth which has been sized up since T-mor.

Malipor tosses Sinco up, who flies almost out of the earth's atmosphere, only to be grabbed from behind while dazed, and slammed straight into the ground.

"NO HYPER FORM TO SAVE YOU NOW!"

Malipor starts rapidly punching Sinco at varying degrees of force.

"You'd... be... surprised..."

Suddenly a massive blue flash of light.

"NO!"

Malipor screams in frustration as Sinco rises, all wounds and bruises being healed and his hair flinging up, quickly Sinco calls out.

"FUERZA!"

A red aura takes over as Hyper Sinco
