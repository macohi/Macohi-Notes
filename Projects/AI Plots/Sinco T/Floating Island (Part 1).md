#plot #sinco 

The island drifted through open sky, its underside wrapped in mist and its surface crowned with unfinished steel.

Sinco landed in a spiral of **green lightning**, shoes scraping against stone as kinetic wind rolled outward. His jacket snapped behind him while he took in the sight ahead—massive alloy pillars locking into place, drones ferrying equipment, a central tower rising like a needle aimed at the heavens.

Tirok’s base was almost operational.

“Can’t let you finish that,” Sinco murmured.

The air behind him shifted.

He barely had time to turn.

A fist drove into his side like a meteor.

The impact detonated the ground beneath him, stone spiderwebbing as Sinco was hurled across the island. He flipped midair and slammed into the earth, carving a trench before skidding to a stop in a spray of dirt.

A shadow fell over him.

Knuren stood at the edge of the crater, shoulders squared, eyes glowing faintly **purple**. The markings along his arms pulsed with the same hue—no energy blasts, no theatrics. Just raw, condensed force humming beneath his skin.

Sinco coughed, pushing himself up. Green sparks danced across his fingers.

“…Okay,” he said, wiping blood from his lip. “I definitely didn’t schedule this.”

Knuren said nothing.

He stepped forward.

The ground cracked under the weight of that single step.

Sinco vanished in a streak of green.

He reappeared behind Knuren, landing three rapid strikes to the ribs, spine, shoulder—each hit snapping with electric discharge meant to stun nerves and overload muscle response.

Knuren didn’t flinch.

He twisted, catching Sinco’s wrist mid-blur.

For half a second, Sinco’s brain stalled.

Knuren swung.

Sinco’s body became a green comet as he was flung across the island, skipping off the ground twice before catching himself in a sliding crouch.

“Still not talking?” Sinco called, lightning crawling brighter along his arms. “Did I miss something? Did I step on sacred moon dirt or—”

Knuren lunged again.

This time Sinco met him head-on. Green lightning exploded outward as he accelerated, weaving around the larger man in impossible angles, striking from every direction. Each punch carried amplified force, each kick layered with electrical propulsion.

Knuren absorbed it.

He wasn’t faster.

He was stronger.

Every counterattack carried crushing weight. When their fists collided, shockwaves rippled through the island, flattening grass and splitting rock. Purple energy flared around Knuren’s arms—not projectiles, not beams—just reinforcement. Every muscle enhanced beyond reason.

Sinco darted backward, breathing sharper now.

He noticed something.

Every exchange was pushing him back—closer to the unfinished base.

“You’re guarding it,” Sinco muttered.

Knuren’s eyes narrowed slightly.

That was confirmation enough.

Sinco surged forward again, feinting left, striking right, trying to redirect the fight’s trajectory. Green lightning zigzagged across the battlefield as he forced Knuren step by step toward the island’s edge instead.

For a moment, it worked.

Knuren slid back a meter.

Then he stopped.

The ground beneath his feet cratered inward.

He inhaled slowly.

Purple energy intensified—not expanding outward, but condensing. Compressing into his frame like gravity folding in on itself.

Sinco’s instincts screamed.

“Don’t—”

Knuren moved.

He didn’t blur.

He launched.

The charge hit like a continent in motion.

Sinco tried to sidestep, but the angle shifted at the last instant. Knuren’s shoulder collided with him, and the follow-up punch landed square in his chest.

The world vanished in white noise.

Sinco rocketed backward, tearing through a stone ridge at the island’s edge. The mountain face shattered around him as he punched through solid rock, deeper and deeper until light disappeared.

Then gravity claimed him.

He burst from the other side of the mountain into open void—and immediately into water.

Cold swallowed him whole.

He plunged through a vast, submerged expanse—an ancient city carved from stone and coral-like structures, towers rising into the cavern ceiling above. Sunlight filtered faintly through fractures overhead, illuminating currents that twisted through broken archways and flooded streets.

Bubbles streamed past his face as he fell.

Green lightning flickered instinctively around him, diffusing harmlessly in the water.

The mountain ruptured above.

Knuren descended through the breach like a falling monument, purple aura cutting through the flood as he dove straight after him.

Even underwater, his movement wasn’t graceful—it was forceful. Each stroke displaced massive amounts of water, propelling him forward with terrifying momentum.

Sinco kicked downward, twisting between submerged columns. The current tugged at him, dragging him sideways through what must have once been a grand avenue. Statues loomed beneath layers of algae, cracked domes shimmering in filtered light.

Knuren closed the distance.

A massive hand reached through the water, fingers inches from Sinco’s ankle.

Sinco’s mind snapped into overdrive.

Water pressure. Structural stress. Flow vectors.

He angled himself upward sharply.

Green lightning flared brighter than before, compressing around him.

With a sharp surge, he blasted upward—superheating the water along his path just long enough to create a violently rising column of steam and propulsion.

Knuren’s grip closed on nothing.

Sinco burst from the water’s surface into the cavern’s upper air pocket, skidding along a slanted wall before flipping upright midair.

Below—

The current shifted.

The blast Sinco created destabilized an already fractured canal system. Ancient stone groaned as a wall collapsed inward. A roaring torrent flooded the lower chamber.

Knuren tried to brace himself against a pillar.

The pillar snapped.

The current swallowed him whole.

Purple light flickered beneath the churning water as he was dragged into a submerged tunnel, vanishing into the roaring depths of the ancient city.

Silence returned slowly.

Sinco hovered above the water, breathing hard, green lightning crackling faintly along his arms.

He looked up through the shattered ceiling toward the open sky beyond.

Toward Tirok’s base.

“…You’re not stopping me,” he muttered.

And with a flash of green, he shot upward through the broken mountain toward whatever waited next.
