The island drifted through open sky, its underside wrapped in mist and its surface crowned with unfinished steel.

[Sinco](../../../Other/Characters/Sinco.md) landed in a spiral of **green lightning**, shoes scraping against stone as kinetic wind rolled outward. His jacket snapped behind him while he took in the sight ahead—massive alloy pillars locking into place, drones ferrying equipment, a central tower rising like a needle aimed at the heavens.

[(Evil) Tirok's](../../../Other/Characters/Tirok.md) base was almost operational.

“Can’t let you finish that,” Sinco murmured.

The air behind him shifted.

He barely had time to turn.

A fist drove into his side like a meteor.

The impact detonated the ground beneath him, stone spiderwebbing as Sinco was hurled across the island. He flipped midair and slammed into the earth, carving a trench before skidding to a stop in a spray of dirt.

A shadow fell over him.

[Knuren](../../../Other/Characters/Knuren.md) stood at the edge of the crater, shoulders squared, eyes glowing faintly **purple**. The markings along his arms pulsed with the same hue—no energy blasts, no theatrics. Just raw, condensed force humming beneath his skin.

Sinco coughed, pushing himself up. Green sparks danced across his fingers.

“…Okay,” he said, wiping blood from his lip. “I definitely didn’t schedule this.”

Knuren said nothing.

He stepped forward.

The ground cracked under the weight of that single step.

Sinco vanished in a streak of green.

He reappeared behind Knuren, landing three rapid strikes to the ribs, spine, shoulder—each hit snapping with electric discharge meant to stun nerves and overload muscle response.

Knuren didn’t flinch.

He twisted, catching Sinco’s wrist mid-blur.

For half a second, Sinco’s brain stalled.

Knuren swung.

Sinco’s body became a green comet as he was flung across the island, skipping off the ground twice before catching himself in a sliding crouch.

“Still not talking?” Sinco called, lightning crawling brighter along his arms. “Did I miss something? Did I step on sacred moon dirt or—”

Knuren lunged again.

This time Sinco met him head-on. Green lightning exploded outward as he accelerated, weaving around the larger man in impossible angles, striking from every direction. Each punch carried amplified force, each kick layered with electrical propulsion.

Knuren absorbed it.

He wasn’t faster.

He was stronger.

Every counterattack carried crushing weight. When their fists collided, shockwaves rippled through the island, flattening grass and splitting rock. Purple energy flared around Knuren’s arms—not projectiles, not beams—just reinforcement. Every muscle enhanced beyond reason.

Sinco darted backward, breathing sharper now.

He noticed something.

Every exchange was pushing him back—closer to the unfinished base.

“You’re guarding it,” Sinco muttered.

Knuren’s eyes narrowed slightly.

That was confirmation enough.

Sinco surged forward again, feinting left, striking right, trying to redirect the fight’s trajectory. Green lightning zigzagged across the battlefield as he forced Knuren step by step toward the island’s edge instead.

For a moment, it worked.

Knuren slid back a meter.

Then he stopped.

The ground beneath his feet cratered inward.

He inhaled slowly.

Purple energy intensified—not expanding outward, but condensing. Compressing into his frame like gravity folding in on itself.

Sinco’s instincts screamed.

“Don’t—”

Knuren moved.

He didn’t blur.

He launched.

The charge hit like a continent in motion.

Sinco tried to sidestep, but the angle shifted at the last instant. Knuren’s shoulder collided with him, and the follow-up punch landed square in his chest.

The world vanished in white noise.

Sinco rocketed backward, tearing through a stone ridge at the island’s edge. The mountain face shattered around him as he punched through solid rock, deeper and deeper until light disappeared.

Then gravity claimed him.

He burst from the other side of the mountain into open void—and immediately into water.

Cold swallowed him whole.

He plunged through a vast, submerged expanse—an ancient city carved from stone and coral-like structures, towers rising into the cavern ceiling above. Sunlight filtered faintly through fractures overhead, illuminating currents that twisted through broken archways and flooded streets.

Bubbles streamed past his face as he fell.

Green lightning flickered instinctively around him, diffusing harmlessly in the water.

The mountain ruptured above.

Knuren descended through the breach like a falling monument, purple aura cutting through the flood as he dove straight after him.

Even underwater, his movement wasn’t graceful—it was forceful. Each stroke displaced massive amounts of water, propelling him forward with terrifying momentum.

Sinco kicked downward, twisting between submerged columns. The current tugged at him, dragging him sideways through what must have once been a grand avenue. Statues loomed beneath layers of algae, cracked domes shimmering in filtered light.

Knuren closed the distance.

A massive hand reached through the water, fingers inches from Sinco’s ankle.

Sinco’s mind snapped into overdrive.

Water pressure. Structural stress. Flow vectors.

He angled himself upward sharply.

Green lightning flared brighter than before, compressing around him.

With a sharp surge, he blasted upward—superheating the water along his path just long enough to create a violently rising column of steam and propulsion.

Knuren’s grip closed on nothing.

Sinco burst from the water’s surface into the cavern’s upper air pocket, skidding along a slanted wall before flipping upright midair.

Below—

The current shifted.

The blast Sinco created destabilized an already fractured canal system. Ancient stone groaned as a wall collapsed inward. A roaring torrent flooded the lower chamber.

Knuren tried to brace himself against a pillar.

The pillar snapped.

The current swallowed him whole.

Purple light flickered beneath the churning water as he was dragged into a submerged tunnel, vanishing into the roaring depths of the ancient city.

Silence returned slowly.

Sinco hovered above the water, breathing hard, green lightning crackling faintly along his arms.

He looked up through the shattered ceiling toward the open sky beyond.

Toward Tirok’s base.

“…You’re not stopping me,” he muttered.

And with a flash of green, he shot upward through the broken mountain toward whatever waited next.

Sinco burst through the fractured mountain ceiling into open sky, green lightning snapping around him like a living storm. Below sprawled the **launch base**—a sprawling industrial construction site suspended in midair, where Tirok’s forces were feverishly assembling the machinery and scaffolding that would become his full Base of Operations. Massive cranes rotated above half-built platforms, conveyor belts ferried components, and robotic welders flared in synchronized chaos.

This was the heart of Tirok’s preparations. If Sinco could cripple it, the Base of Operations wouldn’t even have a chance to rise.

Sinco’s boots kissed the metal catwalks as he streaked forward, moving faster than any eye could track. He leaped across platforms, phasing through thin walls where sparks of electricity licked at exposed circuits. Every weak junction, every overloaded conduit, every support strut that could collapse under a little extra pressure—he found them all.

The hum of machinery filled the launch base as conveyor belts carried parts, welders flared, and scaffolding swayed under the weight of assembling towers. Sinco darted across the labyrinthine site like green lightning incarnate, twisting midair to punch support beams, short-circuit electrical panels, and collapse scaffolding. Every sabotage sent metal crashing, sparks raining down and sending automated drones scattering.

For a while, it was rhythm—Sinco in motion, the launch base slowly crumbling, each section collapsing faster than Tirok’s crew could repair it.

Then Tirok noticed.

From a towering observation platform, Tirok’s eyes narrowed as he tapped holographic consoles. A low hum cut through the air as drones detached from docking bays, their targeting lasers flaring red across the construction site.

Sinco didn’t pause. Drones fired turrets from above; below, spinning saw-blades whirred on mechanical units, cutting through scaffolding.

Green lightning flared. He phased through walls, letting pursuing drones smash into corners. He vaulted over conveyor belts, sending collapsing machinery into pursuing units. One by one, he outsmarted them, dodging, weaving, and striking—his sabotage relentless.

The launch base was a maze, and he used it to his advantage. Every twisted corridor, every scaffolding gap, every partially built catwalk became a trap. He phased through walls, ran up angled beams, or sent green electrical surges into exposed machinery, turning drones into scrap before they even realized what hit them.

But Tirok was patient.

A new hum rumbled through the site as a colossal mech emerged from a docking bay—a humanoid titan bristling with cannons, energy shields, and rocket boosters. It moved with uncanny precision, each footfall shaking the scaffolding. The mech’s visor tracked Sinco without words, only a cold glare.

The battle became brutal.

Sinco darted around, phasing through walls, weaving between scaffolding, striking machinery to collapse it into the mech, each hit sparking green lightning. But the mech anticipated his moves—shields adapting, rockets homing on predicted positions. Every strike Sinco landed barely scratched the armor.

He vaulted over a conveyor belt, green lightning flaring along his arms, striking a support column. It buckled, sending a crane swinging at the mech. It staggered, but recovered in milliseconds.

Sinco’s heart pounded. Each leap, each strike, each maneuver drained him—not from speed, but from force. The mech was built to endure him, to break him. Every shortcut, every wall-phase, every collapsing scaffold bought seconds, but he couldn’t outmaneuver the brute forever.

And then, finally, he faltered.

The mech’s fists pinned him against a wall of steel. Sparks rained as hydraulic pistons strained to hold him down. Sinco struggled, green lightning sputtering, muscles screaming. The mech’s rocket boosters flared, swinging him like a ragdoll.

The pilot’s glare met his through the visor. No words. Nothing but pure, calculated malice. Sinco knew—if he didn’t act now, he was done.

The mech raised a massive fist, energy charging at the knuckles, ready to finish him.

“[FUERZA!](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Fuerza.md)” Sinco screamed.

The world ignited.

Green lightning flared, then snapped into a blazing **red aura** that radiated from him like molten fire. Every movement surged with impossible strength, speed, and precision. His punches struck harder than the mech could withstand. Fuerza—his hidden multiplier—exploded outward, doubling, then tripling the force behind each strike.

The mech staggered. Systems overloaded. Rockets misfired. Shields flickered and popped. Sinco phased through armor plating, sending Tirok spinning inside the cockpit, barely able to stabilize.

Within seconds, the red-green blur was gone—Sinco soaring into the air, leaving the stunned mech staggering, sensors fried, servos burning. He let the Fuerza fade as he shot away, chest heaving, red aura dimming back into green.

From above, a missile fired from the mech. Sinco barely ducked beneath it, green lightning coiling around him as the explosion sent him tumbling, flung away by the shockwave.

High above the industrial launch base, Sinco skimmed through clouds, catching his breath, scanning the distance.

Below, the mech limped back toward the half-ruined construction site. Tirok muttered under his breath, visor reflecting red and green sparks.

“Still… need a power source,” he said, teeth gritted, already plotting the next move.

Sinco let the wind take him, red fading back to green, green sparking faintly as he streaked toward the horizon.

The launch base lay crippled—but the real Base of Operations was still under construction, and the war was far from over.

Sinco hit the ground with a skid of green lightning, boots carving arcs into the pale sand. Around him stretched a new zone of the Floating Island—endless dunes of shifting sand, punctuated by jagged ruins and toppled pillars of an ancient civilization.

The sand was treacherous. Quicksand pits gaped like hungry mouths, waiting for the unwary. Sunlight fractured over scattered stone buildings, casting long shadows that hid dangers beneath the surface.

He breathed hard, surveying the terrain. “Just what I needed… sand, quicksand, and—”

A familiar shadow loomed.

Knuren emerged from the heat haze, soaked as if he had dragged himself through some hidden stream. Sinco’s teeth ground.

“Really? Again?” he muttered, sparks of green flickering along his arms. “You just can’t stay gone, can you?”

Knuren said nothing. He stepped forward, and the ground trembled under his presence. Sand shifted as he walked, quicksand bubbling around his boots. Without warning, he lunged, trying to drive Sinco into the nearest pit.

Sinco twisted in midair, phasing through the sinking sand before it could claim him. He zipped above Knuren, green lightning streaking across the sunlit desert.

Knuren roared, summoning massive boulders from the surrounding ruins, hurling them with brute strength and uncanny precision. Each one whistled through the air like a meteor, crashing into dunes and ancient walls. Sinco barely phased out of the way, vaulting over falling debris and letting the sand swallow nothing but air.

The duel stretched across the zone—Sinco darting, weaving, sabotaging Knuren’s attacks; Knuren smashing, throwing, trying to crush or suffocate his opponent. The ruins shook, sand sprayed, and the heat shimmered with kinetic energy.

Then a boulder—a massive one, jagged and heavy—tore through the air and smashed into an ancient building, sending stone and dust flying. Sinco’s eyes caught the opening. Without hesitation, he dashed inside.

Knuren followed, boots pounding the sand as he entered the shadowed interior. Darkness swallowed the space, walls towering and etched with unreadable runes. Knuren smirked—or maybe it was a grimace—and with a subtle gesture, he activated hidden mechanisms, flooding the hall with pale, violet light.

Sinco’s heartbeat quickened. Shadows shifted with every corner. He waited… timed… then launched himself from the dark, ambushing Knuren with a volley of green-blazing strikes.

The fight tore through the ancient building. Pillars crumbled, etchings shattered, and dust spiraled like smoke from the ceiling. Sand from the desert above sifted in through cracks, settling atop broken stone.

Sinco ducked a swing, phased through a wall, slammed a column into Knuren—but the larger man pressed forward, relentless.

Then the floor collapsed beneath them.

They plummeted through a hidden shaft, sand and dust screaming past them, until a dim light greeted them below.

Sinco landed lightly on the stone floor, green lightning flickering faintly across his frame. He looked up: massive columns and arches surrounded him, walls etched with symbols that hummed faintly with memory.

Knuren’s expression changed—shock, then fury. Recognition burned in his violet eyes.

“You cannot be here!” he roared for the first time, voice echoing through the cavern. “You must be… destroyed!”

Sinco’s hands raised, trying to calm him. “I don’t even want to be here! I don’t know what this place is!”

But Knuren ignored him, muscles tensing, fist raised, brimming with raw strength. He lunged.

Sinco dodged, phasing behind a pillar, delivering a rapid strike that stunned Knuren long enough to knock him out cold. He didn’t waste time—this secret place demanded exploration.

The area whispered of old power. Symbols on the walls twisted and flowed, written in a language that seemed familiar, yet frustratingly just out of reach in memory. Sinco ran his fingers along the carvings, sparks of green tracing the lines. His pulse quickened—not from fear, but recognition. Something here resonated deep inside him.

The chamber stretched ahead, opening slowly into a hall of emerald light. Sinco’s eyes widened. Seven massive emeralds floated on stone pedestals, each cracked, dulled, and gray with age. Their size alone was awe-inspiring.

And then… one more.

Far larger than the others, suspended above a pedestal carved with runes. Its surface shimmered a deep, vibrant green that seemed to pulse with life as Sinco stepped closer. The closer he got, the brighter the glow became, bathing the chamber in a calm, radiant light.

He stepped slowly, almost reverently, studying the massive emerald. Every surface, every crack, every curve felt… alive. The air itself seemed to hum, vibrating with potential, with memory, with something he had known once and forgotten.

And then a shadow moved.

Knuren crashed into the chamber, recovered from his earlier knockout, his violet aura crackling with raw rage.

“You have no right here!” he screamed. “This is sacred! You SHOULD NOT BE HERE!”

Sinco barely had time to react as Knuren’s strikes rained down, each one faster and heavier than before, fueled by fury. He blocked, phased, and dodged, green lightning arcing wildly.

The chamber trembled. Walls shook. Dust fell from the ceiling.

And then, from hidden slots in the chamber walls, ancient machines powered up, gears grinding and targeting the massive green emerald with precise alignment.

Knuren’s eyes blazed. “THE MASTER EMERALD!”

The ground shuddered beneath them. Sinco’s green lightning flickered as he readied himself.

Everything froze for a heartbeat—the massive emerald glowing, Knuren seething with rage, the chamber alive with ancient mechanisms, and Sinco caught between them.

And then…

The fight was about to escalate further.

Sand roared through the ancient chamber, pouring in from cracks and fissures in the Floating Island above. The massive green glow of the Master Emerald was dimmed by whirling grains, swirling into towering mini-tornadoes as the chamber trembled.

The ceiling exploded outward. Tirok landed amidst the sandstorm, boots slamming into stone, a cloak of dust billowing around him. His gaze flicked immediately to Knuren, who had scrambled to block him. Rage twisted Knuren’s features.

“You’ve betrayed this sacred ground!” Knuren roared, violet energy surging around him. He lunged at Tirok, fists aimed to crush the intruder.

But before he could reach him, a sleek drone shot from the shadows, its metallic claws latching onto Knuren. Any resistance was met with a feedback pulse so strong it doubled Knuren’s own force back against him. His body slammed against the wall, violet aura flaring wildly, yet the drone held firm, machine precision overpowering brute strength.

Sinco seized the opening. His boots left trails of green lightning as he shot toward the Master Emerald, grabbing it and blasting upward, tearing through the storming sand as if it were smoke.

“Going somewhere?” Tirok called, voice carrying through the gusting chamber. “You’re coming with me to the Death Star!”

Sinco didn’t respond. He surged upward, green electricity crackling along him, the Master Emerald clutched tight. The Floating Island below began to break apart, chunks of sand and stone falling into the abyss.

Above, Tirok’s Death Star—a massive construction of rotating machinery, towering engines, and lethal scaffolding—rose, engines igniting as the island fragmented beneath it. Sinco pushed higher, weaving through the debris-laden storm, heading straight for the mechanical giant.

The vacuum of near-space awaited. Air thinned, temperature dropped, and green lightning hissed around Sinco. With a flick of his wrist, he phasing through a hatch that Tirok opened just in time for him to get inside. Oxygen rushed in as the hatch sealed behind him, plunging him into the labyrinthine interior of the Death Star.

Immediately, a barrage of drones and robotic sentries attacked. Lasers whipped past him, spinning saw-blades cut the air, and metallic arms swung with calculated precision.

Sinco gritted his teeth. He flickered his green lightning into red as he toggled **Fuerza**, the aura flaring as his power doubled, then receded when he needed finesse. In an instant, he charged forward, phasing through mechanical assaults, striking, punching, and blasting energy back at drones as openings appeared.

The Death Star shuddered around him as he sprinted through corridors, the Master Emerald pulsing in his grasp. Power surged from the gem into the ship. Engines whined, mechanical pistons groaned, and the entire vessel shivered as if alive. Sinco was forced to the ground as the platform beneath him accelerated, corridors stretching as the ship powered up.

More drones appeared. Sinco ducked, punched, ripped holes in their armor, and fired energy blasts into the hull. Sparks and metal rained around him, yet he kept moving—forward, always forward, toward Tirok.

Corridor after corridor, drone after drone, obstacle after obstacle: gravity flips, rotating platforms, energy barriers. Each time Sinco nearly faltered, he phased through walls or twisted his momentum, green lightning and red aura flickering in tandem as he surged forward.

Finally, he reached a tube, narrow and spiraling upward. Hesitation struck him for the first time—a dizzying height, gravity twisting. He closed his eyes, braced himself, and dove in.

Gravity flipped violently. The world spun around him as the tube propelled him upward. Disoriented, Sinco phased mid-spin, using flashes of lightning to stabilize his trajectory. He emerged into a section of the Death Star where gravity returned to normal, corridors widening, yet more mechanical defenses awaited.

Every trap, every rotating floor, every gravity-altering platform tested him. He sprinted, phased, and slammed through obstacles, the Master Emerald pulsing brighter with every second, syncing its energy with the ship.

And then—he arrived.

A massive chamber opened before him. Gravity had stabilized. The Master Emerald glowed in a pedestal at the center, alive and vibrant, illuminating the room with emerald light.

Tirok waited across the room, arms folded, machinery humming behind him. No words passed between them—only the sound of the pulsing engines, the emerald’s hum, and Sinco’s green lightning coiling along his frame.

Sinco stepped forward.

Tirok’s gaze never wavered.

Both of them knew what was coming.

No one moved. No one spoke.

And then, silently, the duel began.

Sinco and Tirok moved as one—charging at each other in an instant, green and red sparks colliding, the corridor shaking from the impact of their speed. The Death Star groaned, machinery rattling, warning lights flashing.

Even Tirok froze mid-step, eyes widening.

The **Master Emerald** was gone.

A streak of violet surged past him. Knuren had arrived, climbing aboard the Death Star like a shadow, fury crackling from every step, the Master Emerald clutched tightly.

Sinco didn’t hesitate. He slammed a punch into Tirok’s chest plate, sending the technocrat staggering backward. Then, boots sparking, he sprinted, phasing between mechanical turrets and laser fire, following the purple aura that only Knuren could generate.

The Death Star’s robotic army activated in full force. Hundreds of drones, mechanized guards, and swinging laser turrets swarmed toward them. Sinco dodged, punched, phased, and ripped holes through machines. Knuren struggled more—he had to shield the Master Emerald while smashing robotic arms and deflecting energy beams. Sparks and smoke filled the corridor as metal twisted under their assault.

Sinco made it to the central chamber where Knuren waited, cornered but unbowed. Breathing hard, Sinco slowed to a stop, green lightning sparking faintly around him. “Name’s Sinco,” he said, offering a hand, voice steady despite the chaos.

Knuren blinked, violet energy flaring around him. “Knuren. Meh,” he muttered, irritation in every syllable. “Finally, someone helping instead of… screwing it all up.”

Together, they ran. The edge of the Death Star loomed ahead, a jagged hole Knuren had torn open with raw strength. Beyond it, the void of space stretched endlessly. Neither could breathe, neither could linger.

Sinco slowed for just a heartbeat, hand reaching toward the **Master Emerald**. He closed his eyes, concentrating. His aura flickered green, then yellow, energy weaving with the emerald’s pulse. Knuren narrowed his eyes. “What—what are you doing?”

Sinco’s voice was calm. “Trust me.”

The Death Star’s automated defenses whirred to life. Tirok and his army arrived in full force, weapons primed, corridors lighting up with red targeting lasers. For him, it was too late.

Sinco’s aura erupted.

His hair spiked upward, golden light cascading from him, eyes blazing red. Chaos energy coursed through him, merging with his lightning, his speed, his phasing. **Super Sinco** was born. The Death Star trembled from the sheer magnitude of his power.

Knuren yelped as the golden figure swooped down, grabbing him and the Master Emerald. Space rushed past, the void pressing against them. Super Sinco shot downward, away from the Death Star, engines and aura blending into one blinding streak of yellow.

Before Tirok could react, Sinco twisted midair, launching a massive energy blast from his palms. The Death Star shuddered violently, machinery exploding, corridors collapsing. The immense yellow light of Super Sinco’s power hammered at the ship, ripping through hulls and power conduits. Sparks rained, metal tore, and the Death Star began a catastrophic descent toward Earth.

Knuren grunted as they flew, holding the Master Emerald. “This… this guy’s insane.”

Sinco’s voice was calm but intense. “I told you to trust me.”

They arrived at the Floating Island. The emerald pulsed in Knuren’s hands, energy spilling outward, reassembling fractured chunks of sand and stone. The island began floating again, whole and alive, bathed in emerald light.

Super Sinco hovered above, chest heaving, hair still spiking, eyes glowing. He gave one last glance at Knuren before disappearing into the horizon, leaving a streak of golden lightning behind.

Knuren stared after him, confused, still holding the Master Emerald. “Meh… okay,” he muttered, shaking his head.

Above, Tirok hovered, fury etched into every line of his face. He watched the Floating Island reconstruct itself, green light washing over it. The Death Star, crippled and spiraling downward, left only smoke and twisted metal in its wake.

Tirok’s fists clenched. “You… Sinco,” he hissed, teeth bared. “I will launch the Death Star. Mark my words.”

Without another word, he shot off into the void, engines blazing, plotting his next move.

The Floating Island was safe—for now.

But the war was far from over.
