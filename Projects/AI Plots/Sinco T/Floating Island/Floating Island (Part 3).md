Sinco hit the ground with a skid of green lightning, boots carving arcs into the pale sand. Around him stretched a new zone of the Floating Island—endless dunes of shifting sand, punctuated by jagged ruins and toppled pillars of an ancient civilization.

The sand was treacherous. Quicksand pits gaped like hungry mouths, waiting for the unwary. Sunlight fractured over scattered stone buildings, casting long shadows that hid dangers beneath the surface.

He breathed hard, surveying the terrain. “Just what I needed… sand, quicksand, and—”

A familiar shadow loomed.

Knuren emerged from the heat haze, soaked as if he had dragged himself through some hidden stream. Sinco’s teeth ground.

“Really? Again?” he muttered, sparks of green flickering along his arms. “You just can’t stay gone, can you?”

Knuren said nothing. He stepped forward, and the ground trembled under his presence. Sand shifted as he walked, quicksand bubbling around his boots. Without warning, he lunged, trying to drive Sinco into the nearest pit.

Sinco twisted in midair, phasing through the sinking sand before it could claim him. He zipped above Knuren, green lightning streaking across the sunlit desert.

Knuren roared, summoning massive boulders from the surrounding ruins, hurling them with brute strength and uncanny precision. Each one whistled through the air like a meteor, crashing into dunes and ancient walls. Sinco barely phased out of the way, vaulting over falling debris and letting the sand swallow nothing but air.

The duel stretched across the zone—Sinco darting, weaving, sabotaging Knuren’s attacks; Knuren smashing, throwing, trying to crush or suffocate his opponent. The ruins shook, sand sprayed, and the heat shimmered with kinetic energy.

Then a boulder—a massive one, jagged and heavy—tore through the air and smashed into an ancient building, sending stone and dust flying. Sinco’s eyes caught the opening. Without hesitation, he dashed inside.

Knuren followed, boots pounding the sand as he entered the shadowed interior. Darkness swallowed the space, walls towering and etched with unreadable runes. Knuren smirked—or maybe it was a grimace—and with a subtle gesture, he activated hidden mechanisms, flooding the hall with pale, violet light.

Sinco’s heartbeat quickened. Shadows shifted with every corner. He waited… timed… then launched himself from the dark, ambushing Knuren with a volley of green-blazing strikes.

The fight tore through the ancient building. Pillars crumbled, etchings shattered, and dust spiraled like smoke from the ceiling. Sand from the desert above sifted in through cracks, settling atop broken stone.

Sinco ducked a swing, phased through a wall, slammed a column into Knuren—but the larger man pressed forward, relentless.

Then the floor collapsed beneath them.

They plummeted through a hidden shaft, sand and dust screaming past them, until a dim light greeted them below.

Sinco landed lightly on the stone floor, green lightning flickering faintly across his frame. He looked up: massive columns and arches surrounded him, walls etched with symbols that hummed faintly with memory.

Knuren’s expression changed—shock, then fury. Recognition burned in his violet eyes.

“You cannot be here!” he roared for the first time, voice echoing through the cavern. “You must be… destroyed!”

Sinco’s hands raised, trying to calm him. “I don’t even want to be here! I don’t know what this place is!”

But Knuren ignored him, muscles tensing, fist raised, brimming with raw strength. He lunged.

Sinco dodged, phasing behind a pillar, delivering a rapid strike that stunned Knuren long enough to knock him out cold. He didn’t waste time—this secret place demanded exploration.

The area whispered of old power. Symbols on the walls twisted and flowed, written in a language that seemed familiar, yet frustratingly just out of reach in memory. Sinco ran his fingers along the carvings, sparks of green tracing the lines. His pulse quickened—not from fear, but recognition. Something here resonated deep inside him.

The chamber stretched ahead, opening slowly into a hall of emerald light. Sinco’s eyes widened. Seven massive emeralds floated on stone pedestals, each cracked, dulled, and gray with age. Their size alone was awe-inspiring.

And then… one more.

Far larger than the others, suspended above a pedestal carved with runes. Its surface shimmered a deep, vibrant green that seemed to pulse with life as Sinco stepped closer. The closer he got, the brighter the glow became, bathing the chamber in a calm, radiant light.

He stepped slowly, almost reverently, studying the massive emerald. Every surface, every crack, every curve felt… alive. The air itself seemed to hum, vibrating with potential, with memory, with something he had known once and forgotten.

And then a shadow moved.

Knuren crashed into the chamber, recovered from his earlier knockout, his violet aura crackling with raw rage.

“You have no right here!” he screamed. “This is sacred! You SHOULD NOT BE HERE!”

Sinco barely had time to react as Knuren’s strikes rained down, each one faster and heavier than before, fueled by fury. He blocked, phased, and dodged, green lightning arcing wildly.

The chamber trembled. Walls shook. Dust fell from the ceiling.

And then, from hidden slots in the chamber walls, ancient machines powered up, gears grinding and targeting the massive green emerald with precise alignment.

Knuren’s eyes blazed. “THE MASTER EMERALD!”

The ground shuddered beneath them. Sinco’s green lightning flickered as he readied himself.

Everything froze for a heartbeat—the massive emerald glowing, Knuren seething with rage, the chamber alive with ancient mechanisms, and Sinco caught between them.

And then…

The fight was about to escalate further.
