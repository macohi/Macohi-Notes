Sinco and Tirok moved as one—charging at each other in an instant, green and red sparks colliding, the corridor shaking from the impact of their speed. The Death Star groaned, machinery rattling, warning lights flashing.

Even Tirok froze mid-step, eyes widening.

The **Master Emerald** was gone.

A streak of violet surged past him. Knuren had arrived, climbing aboard the Death Star like a shadow, fury crackling from every step, the Master Emerald clutched tightly.

Sinco didn’t hesitate. He slammed a punch into Tirok’s chest plate, sending the technocrat staggering backward. Then, boots sparking, he sprinted, phasing between mechanical turrets and laser fire, following the purple aura that only Knuren could generate.

The Death Star’s robotic army activated in full force. Hundreds of drones, mechanized guards, and swinging laser turrets swarmed toward them. Sinco dodged, punched, phased, and ripped holes through machines. Knuren struggled more—he had to shield the Master Emerald while smashing robotic arms and deflecting energy beams. Sparks and smoke filled the corridor as metal twisted under their assault.

Sinco made it to the central chamber where Knuren waited, cornered but unbowed. Breathing hard, Sinco slowed to a stop, green lightning sparking faintly around him. “Name’s Sinco,” he said, offering a hand, voice steady despite the chaos.

Knuren blinked, violet energy flaring around him. “Knuren. Meh,” he muttered, irritation in every syllable. “Finally, someone helping instead of… screwing it all up.”

Together, they ran. The edge of the Death Star loomed ahead, a jagged hole Knuren had torn open with raw strength. Beyond it, the void of space stretched endlessly. Neither could breathe, neither could linger.

Sinco slowed for just a heartbeat, hand reaching toward the **Master Emerald**. He closed his eyes, concentrating. His aura flickered green, then yellow, energy weaving with the emerald’s pulse. Knuren narrowed his eyes. “What—what are you doing?”

Sinco’s voice was calm. “Trust me.”

The Death Star’s automated defenses whirred to life. Tirok and his army arrived in full force, weapons primed, corridors lighting up with red targeting lasers. For him, it was too late.

Sinco’s aura erupted.

His hair spiked upward, golden light cascading from him, eyes blazing red. Chaos energy coursed through him, merging with his lightning, his speed, his phasing. **Super Sinco** was born. The Death Star trembled from the sheer magnitude of his power.

Knuren yelped as the golden figure swooped down, grabbing him and the Master Emerald. Space rushed past, the void pressing against them. Super Sinco shot downward, away from the Death Star, engines and aura blending into one blinding streak of yellow.

Before Tirok could react, Sinco twisted midair, launching a massive energy blast from his palms. The Death Star shuddered violently, machinery exploding, corridors collapsing. The immense yellow light of Super Sinco’s power hammered at the ship, ripping through hulls and power conduits. Sparks rained, metal tore, and the Death Star began a catastrophic descent toward Earth.

Knuren grunted as they flew, holding the Master Emerald. “This… this guy’s insane.”

Sinco’s voice was calm but intense. “I told you to trust me.”

They arrived at the Floating Island. The emerald pulsed in Knuren’s hands, energy spilling outward, reassembling fractured chunks of sand and stone. The island began floating again, whole and alive, bathed in emerald light.

Super Sinco hovered above, chest heaving, hair still spiking, eyes glowing. He gave one last glance at Knuren before disappearing into the horizon, leaving a streak of golden lightning behind.

Knuren stared after him, confused, still holding the Master Emerald. “Meh… okay,” he muttered, shaking his head.

Above, Tirok hovered, fury etched into every line of his face. He watched the Floating Island reconstruct itself, green light washing over it. The Death Star, crippled and spiraling downward, left only smoke and twisted metal in its wake.

Tirok’s fists clenched. “You… Sinco,” he hissed, teeth bared. “I will launch the Death Star. Mark my words.”

Without another word, he shot off into the void, engines blazing, plotting his next move.

The Floating Island was safe—for now.

But the war was far from over.
