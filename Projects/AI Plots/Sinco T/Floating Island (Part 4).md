Sand roared through the ancient chamber, pouring in from cracks and fissures in the Floating Island above. The massive green glow of the Master Emerald was dimmed by whirling grains, swirling into towering mini-tornadoes as the chamber trembled.

The ceiling exploded outward. Tirok landed amidst the sandstorm, boots slamming into stone, a cloak of dust billowing around him. His gaze flicked immediately to Knuren, who had scrambled to block him. Rage twisted Knuren’s features.

“You’ve betrayed this sacred ground!” Knuren roared, violet energy surging around him. He lunged at Tirok, fists aimed to crush the intruder.

But before he could reach him, a sleek drone shot from the shadows, its metallic claws latching onto Knuren. Any resistance was met with a feedback pulse so strong it doubled Knuren’s own force back against him. His body slammed against the wall, violet aura flaring wildly, yet the drone held firm, machine precision overpowering brute strength.

Sinco seized the opening. His boots left trails of green lightning as he shot toward the Master Emerald, grabbing it and blasting upward, tearing through the storming sand as if it were smoke.

“Going somewhere?” Tirok called, voice carrying through the gusting chamber. “You’re coming with me to the Death Star!”

Sinco didn’t respond. He surged upward, green electricity crackling along him, the Master Emerald clutched tight. The Floating Island below began to break apart, chunks of sand and stone falling into the abyss.

Above, Tirok’s Death Star—a massive construction of rotating machinery, towering engines, and lethal scaffolding—rose, engines igniting as the island fragmented beneath it. Sinco pushed higher, weaving through the debris-laden storm, heading straight for the mechanical giant.

The vacuum of near-space awaited. Air thinned, temperature dropped, and green lightning hissed around Sinco. With a flick of his wrist, he phasing through a hatch that Tirok opened just in time for him to get inside. Oxygen rushed in as the hatch sealed behind him, plunging him into the labyrinthine interior of the Death Star.

Immediately, a barrage of drones and robotic sentries attacked. Lasers whipped past him, spinning saw-blades cut the air, and metallic arms swung with calculated precision.

Sinco gritted his teeth. He flickered his green lightning into red as he toggled **Fuerza**, the aura flaring as his power doubled, then receded when he needed finesse. In an instant, he charged forward, phasing through mechanical assaults, striking, punching, and blasting energy back at drones as openings appeared.

The Death Star shuddered around him as he sprinted through corridors, the Master Emerald pulsing in his grasp. Power surged from the gem into the ship. Engines whined, mechanical pistons groaned, and the entire vessel shivered as if alive. Sinco was forced to the ground as the platform beneath him accelerated, corridors stretching as the ship powered up.

More drones appeared. Sinco ducked, punched, ripped holes in their armor, and fired energy blasts into the hull. Sparks and metal rained around him, yet he kept moving—forward, always forward, toward Tirok.

Corridor after corridor, drone after drone, obstacle after obstacle: gravity flips, rotating platforms, energy barriers. Each time Sinco nearly faltered, he phased through walls or twisted his momentum, green lightning and red aura flickering in tandem as he surged forward.

Finally, he reached a tube, narrow and spiraling upward. Hesitation struck him for the first time—a dizzying height, gravity twisting. He closed his eyes, braced himself, and dove in.

Gravity flipped violently. The world spun around him as the tube propelled him upward. Disoriented, Sinco phased mid-spin, using flashes of lightning to stabilize his trajectory. He emerged into a section of the Death Star where gravity returned to normal, corridors widening, yet more mechanical defenses awaited.

Every trap, every rotating floor, every gravity-altering platform tested him. He sprinted, phased, and slammed through obstacles, the Master Emerald pulsing brighter with every second, syncing its energy with the ship.

And then—he arrived.

A massive chamber opened before him. Gravity had stabilized. The Master Emerald glowed in a pedestal at the center, alive and vibrant, illuminating the room with emerald light.

Tirok waited across the room, arms folded, machinery humming behind him. No words passed between them—only the sound of the pulsing engines, the emerald’s hum, and Sinco’s green lightning coiling along his frame.

Sinco stepped forward.

Tirok’s gaze never wavered.

Both of them knew what was coming.

No one moved. No one spoke.

And then, silently, the duel began.
