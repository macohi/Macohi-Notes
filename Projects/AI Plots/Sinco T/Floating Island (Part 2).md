Sinco burst through the fractured mountain ceiling into open sky, green lightning snapping around him like a living storm. Below sprawled the **launch base**—a sprawling industrial construction site suspended in midair, where Tirok’s forces were feverishly assembling the machinery and scaffolding that would become his full Base of Operations. Massive cranes rotated above half-built platforms, conveyor belts ferried components, and robotic welders flared in synchronized chaos.

This was the heart of Tirok’s preparations. If Sinco could cripple it, the Base of Operations wouldn’t even have a chance to rise.

Sinco’s boots kissed the metal catwalks as he streaked forward, moving faster than any eye could track. He leaped across platforms, phasing through thin walls where sparks of electricity licked at exposed circuits. Every weak junction, every overloaded conduit, every support strut that could collapse under a little extra pressure—he found them all.

The hum of machinery filled the launch base as conveyor belts carried parts, welders flared, and scaffolding swayed under the weight of assembling towers. Sinco darted across the labyrinthine site like green lightning incarnate, twisting midair to punch support beams, short-circuit electrical panels, and collapse scaffolding. Every sabotage sent metal crashing, sparks raining down and sending automated drones scattering.

For a while, it was rhythm—Sinco in motion, the launch base slowly crumbling, each section collapsing faster than Tirok’s crew could repair it.

Then Tirok noticed.

From a towering observation platform, Tirok’s eyes narrowed as he tapped holographic consoles. A low hum cut through the air as drones detached from docking bays, their targeting lasers flaring red across the construction site.

Sinco didn’t pause. Drones fired turrets from above; below, spinning saw-blades whirred on mechanical units, cutting through scaffolding.

Green lightning flared. He phased through walls, letting pursuing drones smash into corners. He vaulted over conveyor belts, sending collapsing machinery into pursuing units. One by one, he outsmarted them, dodging, weaving, and striking—his sabotage relentless.

The launch base was a maze, and he used it to his advantage. Every twisted corridor, every scaffolding gap, every partially built catwalk became a trap. He phased through walls, ran up angled beams, or sent green electrical surges into exposed machinery, turning drones into scrap before they even realized what hit them.

But Tirok was patient.

A new hum rumbled through the site as a colossal mech emerged from a docking bay—a humanoid titan bristling with cannons, energy shields, and rocket boosters. It moved with uncanny precision, each footfall shaking the scaffolding. The mech’s visor tracked Sinco without words, only a cold glare.

The battle became brutal.

Sinco darted around, phasing through walls, weaving between scaffolding, striking machinery to collapse it into the mech, each hit sparking green lightning. But the mech anticipated his moves—shields adapting, rockets homing on predicted positions. Every strike Sinco landed barely scratched the armor.

He vaulted over a conveyor belt, green lightning flaring along his arms, striking a support column. It buckled, sending a crane swinging at the mech. It staggered, but recovered in milliseconds.

Sinco’s heart pounded. Each leap, each strike, each maneuver drained him—not from speed, but from force. The mech was built to endure him, to break him. Every shortcut, every wall-phase, every collapsing scaffold bought seconds, but he couldn’t outmaneuver the brute forever.

And then, finally, he faltered.

The mech’s fists pinned him against a wall of steel. Sparks rained as hydraulic pistons strained to hold him down. Sinco struggled, green lightning sputtering, muscles screaming. The mech’s rocket boosters flared, swinging him like a ragdoll.

The pilot’s glare met his through the visor. No words. Nothing but pure, calculated malice. Sinco knew—if he didn’t act now, he was done.

The mech raised a massive fist, energy charging at the knuckles, ready to finish him.

“FUERZA!” Sinco screamed.

The world ignited.

Green lightning flared, then snapped into a blazing **red aura** that radiated from him like molten fire. Every movement surged with impossible strength, speed, and precision. His punches struck harder than the mech could withstand. Fuerza—his hidden multiplier—exploded outward, doubling, then tripling the force behind each strike.

The mech staggered. Systems overloaded. Rockets misfired. Shields flickered and popped. Sinco phased through armor plating, sending Tirok spinning inside the cockpit, barely able to stabilize.

Within seconds, the red-green blur was gone—Sinco soaring into the air, leaving the stunned mech staggering, sensors fried, servos burning. He let the Fuerza fade as he shot away, chest heaving, red aura dimming back into green.

From above, a missile fired from the mech. Sinco barely ducked beneath it, green lightning coiling around him as the explosion sent him tumbling, flung away by the shockwave.

High above the industrial launch base, Sinco skimmed through clouds, catching his breath, scanning the distance.

Below, the mech limped back toward the half-ruined construction site. Tirok muttered under his breath, visor reflecting red and green sparks.

“Still… need a power source,” he said, teeth gritted, already plotting the next move.

Sinco let the wind take him, red fading back to green, green sparking faintly as he streaked toward the horizon.

The launch base lay crippled—but the real Base of Operations was still under construction, and the war was far from over.
