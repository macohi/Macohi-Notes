#plotline #sinco 

I want you to write a story piece for me, don't worry about the before or the after, that's what I'll worry about.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco arrives at an island floating in the sky, he can see Tirok's base of operation being set up on the island.
2. Sinco suddenly gets attacked, Knuren knocks him down.
3. Sinco retaliates, trying to figure out why Knuren is attacking him, Knuren doesn't give a response.
4. Sinco and Knuren fight, Sinco slowly moving towards Tirok's Base of Operations.
5. Knuren then suddenly charges an attack, Sinco can't process it fast enough and then gets blasted into a mountain.

6. Sinco is now inside of an ancient city, filled with water (think Hydrocity Zone from Sonic 3 & Knuckles), falling.
7. Knuren follows, almost grabbing Sinco but then Sinco flies up, letting Knuren fall into the water and be washed away.

Here's some things that I figured needed extra explanation:
