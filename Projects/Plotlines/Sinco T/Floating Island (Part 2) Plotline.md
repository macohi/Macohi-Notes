#plotline #sinco 

Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco lands in a new zone, filled with machinery, a launch base. Tirok's base was nearing completion and Sinco needs to sabotage it.
2. Sinco races through the zone, finding weak spots and sabotaging them.
3. Sinco keeps up with this for awhile but then Tirok notices and sends some of his drones after Sinco
4. Sinco now has to avoid death by the drones firing lazers and the drones with saw, etc etc.
