I HAVE MOTIVATIONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A series of a guy who had the ability to multiply his power with the consequence of it basically killing him : very inspired by the Kaio-Ken.
But he also has a healing factor which keeps him alive and not dead from it, but it gets him stronger.

So basically a Saiyan with Kaio-Ken and healing powers.

Saio-en
Kai-syn / Kai-cyn
Sai-ken
