Fuerza: Fuerza is a technique that multiplies the user's power depending on the multiplier, the default is 2 but can be increased, but the higher multiplier, the more it puts harm and strain on the user. Think the Kaio-Ken from Dragon Ball Z. This technique when used causes a red aura to flare around the user, changing their power color to red, depending on variables.
