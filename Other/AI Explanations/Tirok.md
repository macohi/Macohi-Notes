[Tirok](../Characters/Tirok.md): Grown ass man with issues against kids (Sinco). In all seriousness he's a rich science tech guy that's just, livin' the best life, being... evil... DEPENDING ON WHAT VARIATION ACTUALLY! There's 2: Retold and Evil, Retold Tirok is chill with Sinco and they're friends, but Evil Tirok is just, evil. Don't call them "Retold Tirok" or "Evil Tirok", it's just a way to difference them, but if both are there you can call Evil Tirok "Old Tirok" and Retold Tirok "New Tirok".
