# Overview

Regular humans but they can use their energy in attacks, with only some anomalies appearing, but not major ones.

## Potential Anomalies (HA_**)

Anomalies in regular humans are more minor then how Meta-Humans have full-on powers.

### Healing Strength Factor (HA_02 : Stren Licton)

While humans do technically have a Healing Factor and improves in managing similar conditions that previously were dangerous, in this case its cranked up a little in levels.

- **Level 1** : Wound healing takes 2x less time then normal and the body adapts to danger quicker but still requires a significant amount of exposure.
