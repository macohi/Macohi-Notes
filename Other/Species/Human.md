# Overview

Regular humans but they can use their energy in attacks, with only some anomalies appearing, but not major ones.

## Potential Anomalies (HA_**)

Anomalies in regular humans are more minor then how Meta-Humans have full-on powers.

### Healing Strength Factor (HA_02 : Stren Licton)

While humans do technically have a Healing Factor and improves in managing similar conditions that previously were dangerous, in this case its cranked up a little in levels.

- **Level 1** : Wound healing takes 2x less time then normal and the body adapts to danger quicker but still requires a significant amount of exposure.

- **Level 2**: Wound healing takes 4x less time then normal and the body adapts to danger with less exposure required.

- **Level 3**: Wound healing takes only a couple of days, at max a week depending on the injury and body danger adaption requires exposure 2 - 4 times, depending on the danger.

- **Level 4**: Wound healing takes hours, at max a few days once again depending on the injury. Body danger adaption requires exposure once and the body begins adaption process with the speed increasing with more exposure.

- **Level 5**: Almost-instant wound healing once again depending on injury and body danger adaption is the same but the pace at first exposure
