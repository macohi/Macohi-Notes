# Overview

Regular humans but they can use their energy in attacks, with only some anomalies appearing, but not major ones.

## Human Anomalies (HA_\*\*)

Anomalies in regular humans are more minor then how Meta-Humans have full-on powers, of course being named after discovery.

### Healing Factor (HA_02 : Hiclin)

While humans do technically have a Healing Factor, in this case its cranked up a little in levels.

"Leveling up" is only possible via mutation.

- **Level 1** : Wound healing takes 2x less time then normal.

- **Level 2**: Wound healing takes 4x less time then normal.

- **Level 3**: Wound healing takes only a couple of days, at max a week depending on the injury.

- **Level 4**: Wound healing takes hours, at max a few days once again depending on the injury.

- **Level 5**: Almost-instant wound healing once again depending on injury.

- **Level 6+**: Not researched or discovered, but in theory is possible and would just be instantaneous.

### Body Adaption (HA_05 : Zekin)

While the human body does adapt, a significant amount of exposure or just evolution is required, in levels this will be split.

"Leveling up" is possible with or without mutation.

- **Level 1** : The body adapts to danger quicker but still requires a significant amount of exposure.

- **Level 2**: The body adapts to danger with less exposure required.

- **Level 3**: Body danger adaption requires exposure 2 - 4 times, depending on the danger.

- **Level 4**: Body danger adaption requires exposure once and the body begins adaption process with the speed increasing with more exposure.

- **Level 5**: Body danger adaption is the same but the pace at first exposure is significantly faster.

- **Level 6**: Not researched or discovered, but in theory is just a quicker level 5.

- **Level 7+**: Not researched or discovered, but in theory is possible and would just be instantaneous.
