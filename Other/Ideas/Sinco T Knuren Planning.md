Plans for [Knuren's](../Characters/Knuren.md) involvement so he isn't a one-off.

# Part 1 : Knuren Arc

In Knuren's arc its basically a Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

[Evil Tirok](../Characters/Tirok.md) has tricked Knuren into thinking [Sincos](../Characters/Sinco.md) bad and after the Master Emerald Shards and Chaos Emeralds.

Knuren has the 6 other chaos emeralds and 2 Master Emerald Shards.

With Tirok working with Knuren Tirok also has access to them, and is using them to power a new machine that will allow him to explore the galaxies.

# Part 2 : T-GED ( Galaxy Exploration Device ) Arc

Knuren and Sinco are homies now and they're working together to stop Tirok, they've hoped on T-GED and they are sabotaging it, making a crash land on a random planet that's lightyears away from earth, with our tech anyway lol, in this universe it's just some years away.

A battle then ensues between Knuren and Sinco against Tirok and his new robot army powered by the chaos emeralds.

Once Knuren and Sinco are done with the fight, Tirok performs a flashing technique (Solar Flare hmmm???) that blinds Sinco and Knuren and escapes with a Master Emerald Shard.
