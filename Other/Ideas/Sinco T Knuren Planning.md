Plans for [Knuren's](../Characters/Knuren.md) involvement so he isn't a one-off.

# Part 1 : Knuren Arc

In Knuren's arc its basically a Sonic 3 & Knuckles.

[Evil Tirok](../Characters/Tirok.md) has tricked Knuren into thinking [Sincos](../Characters/Sinco.md) bad and after the Master Emerald Shards and Chaos Emeralds.

Knuren has the 6 other chaos emeralds and 2 Master Emerald Shards.

With Tirok working with Knuren Tirok also has access to them, and is using them to power a new machine that will allow him to explore the galaxies.

# Part 2 : T-GED ( Galaxy Exploration Device ) Arc

Knuren and Sinco are homies now and they're working together to stop Tirok, they've hoped on T-GED and they are sabotaging it, making a crash land on a random planet that's lightyears away from earth, with our tech anyway lol, in this universe it's just some years away.

A battle then ensues between Knuren and Sinco against Tirok and his new robot army powered by the chaos emeralds.

Once Knuren and Sinco are done with the fight, Tirok performs a flashing technique (Solar Flare hmmm???) that blinds Sinco and Knuren and escapes with a Master Emerald Shard.

Knuren then grabs the other Master Emerald Shard and attempts to fly at Tirok with Sinco following suit, Tirok notices and then performs the technique again, this time swiping the Master Emerald Shard from Knuren and striking both Sinco and Osin down.

Tirok uses the Master Emerald Shard to blow up the planet Sinco and Knuren fall onto and they drift in space.

# Part 3 : Space Tournament Arc

Sinco and Knuren wake up on a new planet, welcomed by alien folk they've not seen before.
