# Last Emerald Arc

Using T-mor Issue 2 : There's a villain who's got all the chaos emeralds but one, and that one is the one Sinco's got.

# Space Tournament Arc(s)

A tournament (or multiple) that take place out in space where Sinco and Co realize they need to start training again, mainly for fun, but also protecting the earth too, especially Sinco.

Since Sinco's merged with multiple versions of himself, he's got power, abilities, and techniques, but he just can't remember how to use ALL of them. So he has to relearn things and eventually learn / make new ones.
