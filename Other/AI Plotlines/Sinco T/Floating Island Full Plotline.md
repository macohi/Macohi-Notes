I want you to write a story piece for me, don't worry about the before or the after, that's what I'll worry about.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco arrives at an island floating in the sky, he can see Tirok's base of operation being set up on the island.
2. Sinco suddenly gets attacked, Knuren knocks him down.
3. Sinco retaliates, trying to figure out why Knuren is attacking him, Knuren doesn't give a response.
4. Sinco and Knuren fight, Sinco slowly moving towards Tirok's Base of Operations.
5. Knuren then suddenly charges an attack, Sinco can't process it fast enough and then gets blasted into a mountain.

6. Sinco is now inside of an ancient city, filled with water (think Hydrocity Zone from Sonic 3 & Knuckles), falling.
7. Knuren follows, almost grabbing Sinco but then Sinco flies up, letting Knuren fall into the water and be washed away.
8. Sinco lands in a new zone, filled with machinery, a launch base. Tirok's base was nearing completion and Sinco needs to sabotage it.
9. Sinco races through the zone, finding weak spots and sabotaging them.
10. Sinco keeps up with this for awhile but then Tirok notices and sends some of his drones after Sinco
11. Sinco now has to avoid death by the drones firing lazers and the drones with saw, etc. etc.
12. Sinco slowly but surely still continues sabotaging the launch base, destroying the drones after him in any way he can, the maze that is this launch base helps by quickly turning a corner or phasing through a wall and letting the drone run into the wall or corner.
13. Tirok is tired of this and personally goes after Sinco in a new mech intended to keep pace with Sinco and overpower Sinco.
14. Sinco and Tirok battle for a long period of time, please go into as much detail you can and make it last as long as you can
15. Sinco can't outmaneuver Tirok's mech, and he falters, Tirok is about to land the finishing blow when Sinco calls out: "FUERZA!".
16. Evil Tirok didn't know about Fuerza so his mech is quickly overpowered and Sinco escapes.
17. Sinco flies away and lets the Fuerza power fade away but then Tirok fires a missile at Sinco that had he not ducked under while flying would've killed him, but instead he is just sent flying away by the shockwave.
18. Tirok returns to his new Base of Operation, mumbling about a power source still being required.

Here's some things that I figured needed extra explanation:

[T-mor](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/T-mor.md)

[Sinco](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Sinco.md)

[Tirok](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Tirok.md) (Using Evil Tirok)

[Knuren](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Knuren.md)

Just start with the story, don't write about the past (T-mor).
