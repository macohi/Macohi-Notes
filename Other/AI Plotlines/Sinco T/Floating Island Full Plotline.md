I want you to write a story piece for me, don't worry about the before or the after, that's what I'll worry about.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco arrives at an island floating in the sky, he can see Tirok's base of operation being set up on the island.
2. Sinco suddenly gets attacked, Knuren knocks him down.
3. Sinco retaliates, trying to figure out why Knuren is attacking him, Knuren doesn't give a response.
4. Sinco and Knuren fight, Sinco slowly moving towards Tirok's Base of Operations.
5. Knuren then suddenly charges an attack, Sinco can't process it fast enough and then gets blasted into a mountain.

6. Sinco is now inside of an ancient city, filled with water (think Hydrocity Zone from Sonic 3 & Knuckles), falling.
7. Knuren follows, almost grabbing Sinco but then Sinco flies up, letting Knuren fall into the water and be washed away.
8. Sinco lands in a new zone, filled with machinery, a launch base. Tirok's base was nearing completion and Sinco needs to sabotage it.
9. Sinco races through the zone, finding weak spots and sabotaging them.
10. Sinco keeps up with this for awhile but then Tirok notices and sends some of his drones after Sinco
11. Sinco now has to avoid death by the drones firing lazers and the drones with saw, etc. etc.
12. Sinco slowly but surely still continues sabotaging the launch base, destroying the drones after him in any way he can, the maze that is this launch base helps by quickly turning a corner or phasing through a wall and letting the drone run into the wall or corner.
13. Tirok is tired of this and personally goes after Sinco in a new mech intended to keep pace with Sinco and overpower Sinco.
14. Sinco and Tirok battle for a long period of time, please go into as much detail you can and make it last as long as you can
15. Sinco can't outmaneuver Tirok's mech, and he falters, Tirok is about to land the finishing blow when Sinco calls out: "FUERZA!".
16. Evil Tirok didn't know about Fuerza so his mech is quickly overpowered and Sinco escapes.
17. Sinco flies away and lets the Fuerza power fade away but then Tirok fires a missile at Sinco that had he not ducked under while flying would've killed him, but instead he is just sent flying away by the shockwave.
18. Tirok returns to his new Base of Operation, mumbling about a power source still being required.
19. Sinco falls down back to the ground of the Floating Island, now in a sand zone, quicksand EVERYWHERE with ancient buildings spread across the zone.

20. Knuren returns, soaked, Sinco being irritated at the fact, and Knuren attempts fighting Sinco, attempting to land killing blows or to make Sinco suffocate in the quick sand. Sinco keeps phasing out of the quicksand and speeding above Knuren who sends rocks and boulders at Sinco.

21. The battle continues, but then a boulder Knuren tosses at Sinco crashes into an ancient building, and Sinco runs in.

22. Knuren follows, the building is dark so Knuren turns on the light since he knows where things are, and then Sinco ambushes Knuren.

23. They continue to battle, the Ancient building suffering from collateral damage.

24. Suddenly the floor collapses beneath Knuren and Sinco, and both fall.

25. Sinco and Knuren have fallen to a secret area, to Sinco at least, Knuren recognizes this place and then gets upset, finally speaking for the first time, screaming at Sinco that he cannot be here and must be killed.

26. Sinco attempts to tell Knuren he doesn't want to be here but Knuren is still trying to use brute force.

27. Sinco quickly knocks out Knuren, and goes to explore the area.

28. Ancient messages in another language that seems familiar to Sinco but he can't remember, Sinco continues walking through the area and then arrives at an emerald chamber, there are 7 giant emeralds, all cracked and grayed out, and then 1 emerald that's even bigger then all of them, its green color glows brighter as Sinco gets closer. (Keep this part as slow paced as you can while also having it as long as you can)

29. Sinco suddenly is struck by Knuren again, a fight begins once more, Knuren this time is much more stronger, his power being fueled by rage, Knuren rants and rants, talking about the sacred ground and how Sinco SHOULD, NOT, BE, THERE.

30. Suddenly the room shakes, machines appear targeting the giant green emerald.

31. Knuren screams "THE MASTER EMERALD!"

32. Tirok breaks into the ancient area, sand now flooding the room.

33. Knuren charges at Tirok, feeling betrayed, but a drone quickly pins Knuren to the wall, and any amount of resistance is met with double the force.

34. Sinco charges at the machine grabbing the master emerald, flying upwards to Tirok's Base of Operation, which Tirok mentions is called his "Death Star" on both his and Sinco's way upward.

35. The Floating Island begins to fall, while Tirok, Sinco, and Tirok's Death Star rise.

36. Quickly they are approaching the vacuum of space, Sinco spins into the Death Star through a hatch Tirok opened to get in, he needs air.

37. As soon as Sinco enters the Death Star and the hatch closes, he is immediately attacked by a barrage of Tirok's Drones and Robots.

38. Sinco quickly enables and disables Fuerza, quickly charging forward as soon as the barrage is affected.

39. Sinco is running inside of Tirok's Death Star, seeing as the Master Emerald is inserted into it and feeling the Death Star power up and speed up. Being forced to the ground and it speeds up.

40. More drones and robots come at Sinco, who dodges and punches, ripping holes in them and firing energy blasts at them and the Death Star, in an effort to keep going and in an effort to stop the Death Star.

41. Sinco speeds ahead, getting closer and closer to Tirok, the same cycle repeating of drones attempting to stop him.

42. Sinco then stops, noticing the way forward is only through a tube that aims upward.

43. After some hesitation Sinco goes into the tube, being flown upwards and gravity is now flipped, Sinco is dazed for a bit and then proceeds once more.

44. Sinco proceeds through the Death Star, facing different gimmicks (including the gravity flipping) and obstacles until finally, Sinco arrives, gravity is flipped (to be normal), and Tirok is waiting on the other side.

45. Sinco enters the room, Tirok waiting, the Master Emerald visible besides the room.

46. Sinco and Tirok stare at each other, each preparing for a duel.


Here's some things that I figured needed extra explanation:

[T-mor](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/T-mor.md)

[Sinco](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Sinco.md)

[Tirok](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Tirok.md) (Using Evil Tirok)

[Knuren](../../../Other/AI%20Explanations/Knuren.md)

Just start with the story, don't write about the past (T-mor).
