Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Tirok breaks into the ancient area, sand now flooding the room.

2. Knuren charges at Tirok, feeling betrayed, but a drone quickly pins Knuren to the wall, and any amount of resistance is met with double the force.

3. Sinco charges at the machine grabbing the master emerald, flying upwards to Tirok's Base of Operation, which Tirok mentions is called his "Death Star" on both his and Sinco's way upward.

4. The Floating Island begins to fall, while Tirok, Sinco, and Tirok's Death Star rise.

5. Quickly they are approaching the vacuum of space, Sinco spins into the Death Star through a hatch Tirok opened to get in, he needs air.

6. As soon as Sinco enters the Death Star and the hatch closes, he is immediately attacked by a barrage of Tirok's Drones and Robots.

7. Sinco quickly enables and disables Fuerza, quickly charging forward as soon as the barrage is affected.

8. Sinco is running inside of Tirok's Death Star, seeing as the Master Emerald is inserted into it and feeling the Death Star power up and speed up. Being forced to the ground and it speeds up.

9. More drones and robots come at Sinco, who dodges and punches, ripping holes in them and firing energy blasts at them and the Death Star, in an effort to keep going and in an effort to stop the Death Star.

10. Sinco speeds ahead, getting closer and closer to Tirok.
11.
