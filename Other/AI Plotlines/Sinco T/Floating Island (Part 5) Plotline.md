Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco and Tirok are charging at each other in an instant but the Death Star rumbles.
2. Even Tirok is surprised when he notices the Master Emerald missing.
3. Knuren has arrived on the Death Star and is taking his emerald back
4. 

Here are some notes:

Knuren is much more talkative now, being very irritated at Tirok, but with Sinco it's just a "Meh" kind of feeling.
