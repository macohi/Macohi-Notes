Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco and Tirok are charging at each other in an instant but the Death Star rumbles.

2. Even Tirok is surprised when he notices the Master Emerald missing.

3. Knuren has arrived on the Death Star and is taking his emerald back

4. Sinco punches Tirok and then runs backwards, following the purple aura of Knuren.

5. Tirok's entire robotic army attempts attack on Sinco and Knuren, both manage but it's difficult, especially for Knuren who has to make sure the Master Emerald doesn't fall.

6. Sinco breaks out into the center of the Death Star to join Knuren, running with him to escape, also introducing himself and getting Knuren's name.

7. Sinco and Knuren are at the edge, they are right next to the entrance Knuren made by breaking a hole in the Death Star, but they're in space now so neither can breathe.

8. Sinco puts his hand on the Master Emerald, closing his eyes and focusing. This irritates Knuren who is confused by Sinco's action.

9. Suddenly Tirok and his robot army arrives but for Tirok it's too late.

10. Sinco transforms, his new yellow glow fills the Death Star.

11. Tirok and Knuren are blinded, Super Sinco takes Knuren and the Master Emerald out of the Death Star and flies them down towards Earth.

12. Super Sinco turns around real quick to send out an energy blast at the Death Star, his power is immense, and it almost completely destroys the Death Star which begins it's descent to Earth.

13. Super Sinco, Knuren, and the Master Emerald eventually arrive at the Floating Island, Super Sinco then leaves, Knuren being confused at what just happened.

14. Tirok is flying above the Floating Island, watching Super Sinco fly away and eventually watching the Floating Island piece itself together via the Master Emerald's energy and then starts floating again.

15. Tirok swears at Sinco that he will launch the Death Star, and to mark his words.

16. Tirok flies away.

Here's some things that I figured needed extra explanation:

Here are some notes:

Knuren is much more talkative now, being very irritated at Tirok, but with Sinco it's just a "Meh" kind of feeling.
