Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco falls down back to the ground of the Floating Island, now in a sand zone, quicksand EVERYWHERE with ancient buildings spread across the zone.

2. Knuren returns, soaked, and attempts fighting Sinco, attempting to land a killing blow or trying to make Sinco suffocate in the quick sand. Sinco keeps phasing out of the quicksand and speeding above Knuren who sends rocks and boulders at Sinco.

3. The battle continues, but then a boulder Knuren tosses at Sinco crashes into an ancient building, and Sinco runs in.

4. Knuren follows, the building is dark so Knuren turns on the light since he knows where things are, and then Sinco ambushes Knuren.

5. They continue to battle, the Ancient building suffering from collateral damage.

6. Suddenly the floor collapses beneath Knuren and Sinco.
