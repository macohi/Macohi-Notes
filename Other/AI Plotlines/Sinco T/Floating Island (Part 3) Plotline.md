Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco falls down back to the ground of the Floating Island, now in a sand zone, quicksand EVERYWHERE.
2. Knuren returns, soaked, and attempts fighting Sinco, attempting to land a killing blow or trying to make Sinco suffocate in the quick sand. Sinco keeps phasing out of the quicksand and speeding above Knuren who sends rocks and boulders
