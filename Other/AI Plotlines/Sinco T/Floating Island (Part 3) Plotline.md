Please continue the previous tale.

Here is a step-by-step of the story plotline that I want you to expand into a full story bit:

1. Sinco falls down back to the ground of the Floating Island, now in a sand zone, quicksand EVERYWHERE with ancient buildings spread across the zone.

2. Knuren returns, soaked, Sinco being irritated at the fact, and Knuren attempts fighting Sinco, attempting to land killing blows or to make Sinco suffocate in the quick sand. Sinco keeps phasing out of the quicksand and speeding above Knuren who sends rocks and boulders at Sinco.

3. The battle continues, but then a boulder Knuren tosses at Sinco crashes into an ancient building, and Sinco runs in.

4. Knuren follows, the building is dark so Knuren turns on the light since he knows where things are, and then Sinco ambushes Knuren.

5. They continue to battle, the Ancient building suffering from collateral damage.

6. Suddenly the floor collapses beneath Knuren and Sinco, and both fall.

7. Sinco and Knuren have fallen to a secret area, to Sinco at least, Knuren recognizes this place and then gets upset, finally speaking for the first time, screaming at Sinco that he cannot be here and must be killed.

8. Sinco attempts to tell Knuren he doesn't want to be here but Knuren is still trying to use brute force.

9. Sinco quickly knocks out Knuren, and goes to explore the area.

10. Ancient messages in another language that seems familiar to Sinco but he can't remember, Sinco continues walking through the area and then arrives at an emerald chamber, there are 7 giant emeralds, all cracked and grayed out, and then 1 emerald that's even bigger then all of them, its green color glows brighter as Sinco gets closer. (Keep this part as slow paced as you can)

11. Sinco suddenly is struck by Knuren again,
